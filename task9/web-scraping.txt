Your goal is to define what web-scraping is and why it is so exciting and interesting. 
To do that, rewatch our last episode and do your own research about Python & its role in Web Scraping. 
Create a web-scraping.txt file and write down with your own words what web scraping is and what kind of tools or technologies you think you need to do web scraping. 
It doesn't have to be perfect/correct. 
The goal is to put some time into it and think about that.


Answer:


Web Scraping is a method that is determined to gather information from a website automatically.
Web Scraping can either be used in a good or bad way, for example by searching machines like google or to steal content for example by an attacker who rebuilds a website to take over a identity. 
 
Some technologies needed for webscraping are: 

HTML knowledge (e.g. GET method) 
programming ability (e.g. python)
aaand some knowledge of usefull libraries  
The URL of the website to scrape
maybe some RegEx (yeeeahhhh here we are again, party) 

I definitly forgot something.

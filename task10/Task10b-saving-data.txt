# Now think of a way how other people could get access to this data. 
# How would you make the data available for me so I could check the members, add or delete members?

Data could be safed in different forms of databases like relational databases or objectorientated databases or you store them in raw-format in a timebased filesystem like splunk does. 
(This btw. has the benefit that no information is lost until you ask it a question, you're welcome ;)

If you'd like to share the safed data you might host your database or splunksystem in a cloud and create users with different access-levels to the data.
